This application was made to create an algorithm to make transactions that bank would make. I have always been interested in how databases for banks worked, so I decided to make on for myself. The user is given a transaction list, as well as the ability to choose to either deposit or withdraw cash from their bank. The current amount in their bank account is then live updated, and shown to the user.
